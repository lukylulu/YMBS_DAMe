This repository contains the data, pre-processing steps, techniques and software that we are going to use on day 2 of YMBS. If you cannot get the data from the repository, then please get them from me (USB stick). 

The major steps that we are going to do today. 
1. Pre-processing steps: Quality checks, adapter removal, quality trimming, error correction, merging of reads.
2. Sorting and Filtering: Demultiplexing, filtering for features
3. Clustering: From sequences to OTU table.
